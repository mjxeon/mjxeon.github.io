    setCart(prev => {
      const existing = prev.find(item => item.id === product.id);
      if (existing) {
        return prev.map(item => 
          item.id === product.id 
            ? { ...item, quantity: item.quantity + 1 }
            : item
        );
      }
      return [...prev, { ...product, quantity: 1 }];
    });
  };
  
  return { cart, addToCart };
};
```
