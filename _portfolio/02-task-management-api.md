## Overview

A robust task management API supporting team collaboration, real-time updates, and comprehensive project tracking. Built with scalability and performance in mind.

## API Features

- **User Management**: Registration, authentication, and profile management
- **Project Organization**: Create and manage multiple projects
- **Task Operations**: CRUD operations with priority levels and deadlines
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live collaboration
- **File Attachments**: Support for task-related file uploads
- **Advanced Filtering**: Query tasks by status, priority, assignee, and dates

## Technical Specifications

### Database Design
- PostgreSQL with optimized indexes
- Normalized schema with proper foreign key relationships
- Database migrations and seeding scripts
- Connection pooling for performance

### Authentication & Security
- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- CORS configuration for cross-origin requests

### Real-time Features
```javascript
// Socket.io implementation for real-time updates
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  socket.on('join-project', (projectId) => {
    socket.join(`project-${projectId}`);
  });
  
  socket.on('task-update', (data) => {
    socket.to(`project-${data.projectId}`)
          .emit('task-updated', data);
  });
});
```

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: 95% code coverage with Jest
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoint testing
- **Load Testing**: Performance testing with Artillery
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing with GitHub Actions

## Performance Optimizations

- Database query optimization with proper indexing
- Response caching for frequently accessed data
- Pagination for large datasets
- Compression middleware for reduced response sizes

## Deployment & DevOps

- Containerized with Docker
- Deployed on AWS EC2 with load balancing
- Environment-based configuration
- Monitoring with CloudWatch
- Automated backups and disaster recovery
