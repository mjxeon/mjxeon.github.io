## Technical Architecture

### Data Pipeline
```python
# Data processing pipeline
class DataProcessor:
    def __init__(self, source_config):
        self.source = source_config
        
    def extract_data(self):
        # Extract from multiple data sources
        return pd.read_sql(query, self.connection)
    
    def transform_data(self, raw_data):
        # Clean and transform data
        cleaned_data = raw_data.dropna()
        return cleaned_data.groupby(['region', 'date']).sum()
    
    def load_data(self, processed_data):
        # Load into visualization database
        processed_data.to_sql('analytics', self.db_engine)
```

### Visualization Components
- Custom D3.js charts with smooth animations
- Interactive filters and date range selectors
- Responsive design using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Real-time updates using WebSockets

## Key Achievements
